description: After experiencing 2015 earthquake, I wanted to contribute to the humanitarian sector as I admired the bravery
and selflessness of the frontline disaster responders. I wanted to help them in disaster response and recovery by
building an autonomous drone system that would carry and transport the critical medical supplies where a
traditional vehicle could not reach.
Built an autonomous drone system (no human controller required)
It carried medical payload and dropped it with a parachute on reaching the disaster site
Telemetry communication through internet by leveraging 3G cellular network,
Featured unlimited range as it is not controlled by a remote device rather its command and control is
routed through the internet
Used a python library called Dronekit and Mavlink protocol for communication with the on-board
companion computer i.e. a Raspberry Pi 3
A Virtual Private Server host on the internet to broker the connection between the drone and the ground
control station (GCS)
